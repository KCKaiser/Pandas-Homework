    Given the data given, it appears that out of all the players who have purchased items, a majority of them identify as male. We cannot suggest it is because males are more likely to spend money on the game when playing or there is simply a larger number of male players of the game as we do not have any data on non-paying players. It is possible that only a small percentage of the total players identify themselves as males, but a much larger percentage of males pay compared to the other gender groups. Likewise, it is also possible that there is an overwhelmingly large number of male players compared to the other genders and only a very small percentage of them pay. Unless we include data for all players, we can only assert that the majority of the paying players are male.
    
     Looking at the average purchase price, it appears that on average male pay only slightly more than females. The average purchase for inidivudals under "Other/Non-Disclosed" category is much higher, though it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion from this, as it may simply be that there are such a low number of individuals in the category that a few big spenders may by chance dramatically affect the average. 
     
     The largest percentage of purchases were done by individuals between the ages of 21 to 25, followed by individuals between the ages of 16 and 20. The ages 21 to 25 typically correspondes to an age range when individuals are coming out of school and starting to have expendable income from their jobs, which may explain the large number of purchases from the age group. However, as with gender, we cannot assume players between the ages of 21 to 25 are just more likely to be making purchases while playing as we lack any demographic data on non-paying individuals.
